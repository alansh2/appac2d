## `APPAC2D: Potential flow-based solver for airfoils with jet flow in MATLAB`

`APPAC2D` (**A**ero**P**ropulsive **PA**nel **C**ode in Two Dimensions) is a `MATLAB` / `OCTAVE`-based panel method that solves the linear small-disturbance Prandtl-Glauert equation for subsonic flow for single or multielement airfoil systems with or without an interacting jet flow.

On-body values and integrated quantities are readily available by calling `panel2d()` with `influence.m` and `wakeSolver.m` on the search path. For details on syntax, enter `help panel2d` in the Command Window. All other contents are not necessary to the function of the analysis code, but provide easy access to sophisticated flow visualization tools. In particular, velocity fields are created on unstructured triangular grids generated by "provably-good" algorithms in `MESH2D` while streamlines are drawn directly from these unstructured data (no data loss from grid conversion). Outside the aeropropulsive capabilities of `APPAC2D`, it functions as a conventional vortex panel method compatible with both single and multielement airfoil systems. **In an aeropropulsive analysis, the first two surfaces MUST be provided as described: the FIRST surface bounds the propulsive region from BELOW, the SECOND surface bounds the propulsive region from ABOVE.** Remaining surfaces can be supplied in any order.
